                     <p>Postpaid plans are part of T-mobile's mobile portfolio, allowing customers to pay after service on a reoccuring monthly basis. This was a massive undertaking, involving a team of over 300 people. I was the lead for the UX team, managing a team of 6 designers. We were responsible for creating the wireframes attached to user stories. The objective for our team was to create seamless user expereience across the different shopping channels: retail, care, and web by using an atomic design system. This was done by leveraging reusable components from FUSE as well as going to the retail stores, call centers, and website to capture the existing experiences.

                      <p>We primarily worked with the TPO team and HTML team. The technical product owner team was responsible for creating the functional user stories that describe the flow and functionality on the screen. The UX team would then build out the user stories into wirefames. Once the functional analyst was happy with the screens, they were then sent to the HTML team. After the HTML team finished building the screens, the UX team would perform visual QA and capture any visual defects.</p>

                      <p>Users stories and bugs were created/tracked using Rally. We created wireframes using Axure, loading in established widgets through Axure's library function. This allowed for any updates to widgets to cascade across all wireframes. Page templates were also imported into the RP file for common pages which helped expedite new tracks being built and ensure consistency across tracks.</p>

					 </div>
				  </div>
				<div class="contentWrapper_portfolio"> 
				<p>Since there were 6 designers on the project delivering 50+ wireframes every sprint, we used Beanstalk to track changes across wireframes. This helped us avoid any change conflicts and ensured every designer had the latest wireframes changes. Designers would check out rp files when they were working on a specific track, and check it back in after completing all the changes.</p>

                      <p>As mentioned earlier, we followed atomic design principles, by using reusable componented outlined in FUSE. It served as a design resource guide with a list of patterns to select from. Each pattern had its own page covering when to use it, the visual style such as hex code, as well as how it would appear across different breakpoints (320/768/992). This information was also captured in the widgets on the wireframe through widget notes. This allowed the developers to quickly code the screen, as they had code snippets for the different patterns, which helped reduce visual defects in the UI.</p>

                      <p>Since the design team was generating 50+ stories every sprint, there was a need to come up with a flexible naming scheme for the wireframes, so they would be easy to reference. Wireframes were prefaced with the track (i.e. bring your own device) followed by the creative ID (i.e. 10.1.1). Sometimes wireframes had several variants, such as displaying different messages in a popup, and these were differentiated by having the same creative ID, but adding a letter (i.e. 10.1.1a). Originally this was hosted in a spreadsheet, but we later migrated it into Rally so it was more easily searchable.</p>

They would identify the screens required by generating the expected process flow. For each screen in the flow, a design user story would be created in the design kanban. Below is an example of the remorse exchange flow, where an existing customer is authenticated and exchanges a device from the customer's account within the remorse period.</p>

They would assign themselves to the story, and move the story from "None" to "Design." They would create a new creative ID for the wireframe and update the user story, checking the wireframe index to ensure it doesn't exist yet. Sometimes user stories were delayed or pushed back, which were then moved to the "On Hold" column.</p>

                      <p>Once the wireframe passed review and all the requested issues were resolved, it was marked as complete. One designer was assigned as the kanban keeper each sprint, and was responsible for taking stories in the "Complete" column and duplicating them into dev stories to be added to the dev kanban. This included updating the linked parent/feature, adding a screenshot, changing the state, and assigning the story to the next sprint, since dev operated one sprint later than design. Once the story was created and the wireframe was added to the wireframe index, it was moved to the "Approved" column.</p>

                      <p>As the UX lead for the project, I had several additional responsibilities besides managing the team. I was also responsible for providing bi-weekly updates to senior leadership regarding our performance and any potential risks/issues. This was a challenge since UX doesn't have the traditional KPI's available that others say developers use like effort and velocity. As a result, I came up with my own custom report, that provided metrics such as wireframes delivered, defects captured, etc. which were useful to leadership.</p>

					<p>Finally, I was also responsible for leading product demos to leadership whenever we had a major release. When I first joined the team, there wasn't any visual QA of the HTML screens. However, I quickly discovered during the earlier product demos that visual defects would often slip through the cracks, and although cosmetic, it did not reflect well with leadership. The implementation of the grid for HTML was also one of my contributions, after discussing with HTML how best to reduce the visual defects after dev handoff.</p>
