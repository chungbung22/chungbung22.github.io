                     <p>Prepaid plans are part of T-mobile's mobile portfolio, allowing customers to pay before service. I worked with 3 other designers as part of the prepaid effort to establish consistency between the project (Rebellion) and other projects at T-mobile (Frontline). Currently a number of patterns are either Rebellion only, or non-Rebellion, which creates a lot of discrepancies when a customer switches platforms. One example is field labels which are shown below. </p>

                      <p>The DRG was created to serve as a design aid for Rebellion, defining the common elements used in the tool, the appropriate tone of voice for syntax, and other helpful pages such as spacing examples and how to load the widget library into Axure. When I first joined the project, it was stored in an Axure file published to Axshare.</p>

Having inconsistent syntax, such as for submitting a form or confirming an input, could lead to user error, which would lower customer satisfaction. Examples were provided in this section to ensure the right tone of voice was used.</p>

                      <p>The design elements captured in the DRG were broken up based on whether they were global or page-specific. There was also a separate section for visual styling, such as the expected color palette, and the appropriate typography and text size to use for headers vs. body text. Information about how the widget would display in different breakpoints (320/768/992) was also included.</p>

				  </div>
				  <div class="contentWrapper_portfolio"> 
					<p>The page-specific elements section was used for bigger components, which were usually made up of multiple global elements. These were important since they would be used on multiple screens and saved the designer a lot of time from having to build the component. It also helped reduce discrepancies between screens, since some of the components were quite complicated to build.</p>

                      <p>The appendix included useful pages that did not fit under any of the previous categories.

				<p>One of my contributions was the spacing examples, as I noticed that newer designers often had to ask more experienced designers what the recommended spacing should be when it wasn't covered by the sizing/spacing matrix. This would later be included in the new FUSE page as well.</p>

While the DRG was a style guide, FUSE is a complete design system, with tools for UX and development working on Frontine/Rebellion to reduce rework and achieve consistency. We took functionality from the original DRG and added new improvements, such as the ability to search for patterns by name or ID, copying HTML directly from the pattern page, seeing hex and spacing values alongside the base specs, and centralizing all pattern information in one singular source of truth. The initial concept was prototyped using Axure, and tested with other designers at T-mobile for feedback.</p>

                      <p>In order to standardize patterns across different organizations, the concept of sister patterns and pattern pairs was introduced. Sister patterns were patterns that shared the same functionality but were specific to an organization (i.e. Rebellion ONLY). They would have different pattern IDs. Pattern pairs were patterns that shared the same HTML code, but had different states, such as input fields or buttons. They would share the same pattern ID. The goal was to eventually phase out the existence of sister patterns in the future.</p>

                      <p>One of the biggest improvements over the DRG was the ability to search for patterns by name or ID. Previously you had to click through several pages in the DRG until you could find the relevant pattern since some patterns were grouped under a bigger category like form selectors. There was also less real estate available for each component, since multiple components were listed on each page. Although not used often, being able to search by pattern ID can be useful, when a widget on a wireframe is missing its pattern name.</p>

				  <div class="contentH3">Viewing pattern details</div>
                      <p>On the pattern details page, the user is able to view how the widget looks across multiple breakpoints. Instead of having to toggle within axshare which is not intuitive, toggle buttons are now available. Also the HTML code for the pattern is available on this page, which makes it easier to copy/paste HTML code snippets, instead of referencing a separate guide. Finally, the base specs and hex codes are now side by side, so it's easier to differentiate colors in the base specs like @gray-darker and @gray without having to open the colors page in the DRG.</p>

                      <p>The FUSE pattern library is constantly evolving and as new experiences get developed, there's often a need for new patterns. As a result, an intake form was created, allowing designers across the organization to request new patterns to be added to FUSE. The developers on our team would do an impact assessment regarding the amount of effort required. Then it would be prioritized at sprint planning. Once the pattern was designed by the team and approved by the stakeholder, it was then coded and added to the Axure library. Newly added patterns were communicated to other designers via a distribution list, reminding them to update their axure library.</p>

                      <p>The ability to submit defects was also implemented as sometimes newly implemented patterns weren't coded correctly in the HTML. The backlog was shared with newly approved patterns, allowing for the team to prioritize their work, and gives the requestor visibility of the current queue. If a defect or pattern was needed immediately, the user could mark the story as high priority. Sometimes defects that were submitted were rejected, usually if the user hadn't pulled the latest library changes.</p>
