                        <p>Few things compare to the experience of riding. From the feel of the bike
						beneath your body, to the way the tires grab the road as you round into a
						curve, nothing compares to the visceral immersion with the environment as
						the wind blows past your body. Yet, any feelings of exuberance and liberation
						aside, motorcyclists find themselves in dangerous and even life-threatening
						situations on a daily basis.</p><br/>
						<p>Skry is the first advanced awareness and hazard reporting system for motorcyclists. This system leverages map, weather, and traffic data, as well as crowdsourced feedback from other riders, to alert a ride of what's up ahead on their route. With the user of voice UI and HUD, the rider is forewarned of impending events, without taking their eyes off the road or their hands off the controls.</p>

                     <p>Although motorcyclists account for just 3% of the vehicles registered, they make up 14% of al traffic fatalities (NTSA, 2015). In fact, if a motorcyclist is in a traffic accident they are 26 times more likely to die than if they were in a car. Given those statistics, motorcycling is one of the most dangerous methods of transportation in the world.</p>
					 <p>To date, no technology exists to specifically support the rider in providing increased situational awareness about what is ahead on their route. As such, the target user for this study were motorcyclists who use navigation while riding.</p>

                   <p>We began our project with a focus on answering the following three research questions in order to gain a deep understanding into our problem space.</p>
				   <p>1. What types of situations or environments would a rider need an increase in situational awareness?</p>
				   <p>2. What situations and environments are perceived as dangerous by the rider?</p>
				   <p>3. When are riders cognitively taxed?</p>
				   <p>We answered these questions using the following methods:</p>

                  <div class="contentH3">Literature Review</div>
                   <p>Through our investigation of the seconday research, we found that motorcycling requires a high level of situational awareness. While on the bike, the rider is constantly perceiving information about their environment, processing that information, and then making a decision on how to react while managing their own mental and physical workload (Bellet & Banet, 2012).</p>
				   <p>The necessity to maintain a high level of situational awareness is further magnified by the lack of protection that a motorcycle provides vs a car due to the lack of a protective barrier beteen the rider and their environment. A pothole or gravel may not cause a driver harm, but may pose a real threat to a rider's safety.</p>

				   <div class="contentH3">Survey</div>
                   <p>Before moving to the interviews, we surveyed over 240 riders in order to identify the most dangerous situations they encountered, which would we could then validate and explore further during our interviews. The top 3 hazards from the survey were:</p>
				   <p>1. Cars turning left in front of them</p>
				   <p>2. Cars merging into them</p>
				   <p>2. Unexpected road hazards</p>

				   <div class="contentH3">Expert Interview</div>
                   <p>We interviewed 5 subject matter experts and learned that the design of a system to support the rider should make them smarter on the road. Specificallly it should shorten the time between intent and action, and anticipate the needs of the rider to help them make quick and accurate decisions through meaningful and relevant information.</p>
				   <p>We also learned that over reliance on a system could lead to degradation in riding skills. An example was blind spot indicators in cars, which could lead to riders becoming less aware of what's coming up behind them. In fact, the only technology on motorcycles adapted from cars was antilock brakes.</p>

                   <p>We then conducted interviews with 7 riders from varying levels of riding experience. All the riders interviewed said that one of the main reasons for riding was the sense of freedom and oneness with the road. Therefore, any system we design should not interfere with the riders experience on the road.</p>
				   <p>We also conducted a card-sorting task to rank and group different hazards encountered by riders. Cars were ranked as the most dangerous hazard to the rider. However all riders spoke of mitigation strategies to deal with this such as making sure the driver looks them in the eye before turning or revving their engine to make others aware of them.</p>
				   <p>The next most dangerous hazards were unexpected hazards like gravel, oil, bad weather, etc where there was not enough time to decide on a mitigation strategy. Many of them also stated that they had dropped their bike due to unexpected hazards.</p>

                   <p>Based on our research we came up with 3 key findings:</p>
				   <p>1. The proposed solution should avoid cognitive overload while giving the rider time to plan ahead</p>
				   <p>2. Technologies need to support the riders without causing them to be too reliant on the system</p>
				   <p>3. A successful system should not interfere with the riders experience on the road</p>

                   <p>Before moving onto the ideation phase, we also conducted a competitive analysis to make sure an existing system didn't already exist that could satisfy the needs of the rider. It would have to provide situational awareness of what's up ahead, and allow the rider to easily and safely interact with the system while on the road.</p>
				   
				   <p>We identified three current systems available today: Waze, BMW Navigator V, and Skully AR-1. However, after completing the competitive analysis, we found that no one system currently existed to support the rider in all the criteria we had identified from our user research.</p>

                   <p>We leveraged both unstructured and structured ideation activities to help generate a broad set of concepts for our design problem. To start, we began diverging from our initial research insights, with each group member generating ideas by sketching individual thumbnails.</p>
				   <p>We created the following three design prompts based on the key findings to facilitate our thumbnail sketches:</p>
				   <p>1. How can we reduce the cognitive load of motorcyclists?</p>
				   <p>2. What information can be provided to others on the road about motorcyclist behavior?</p>
				   <p>3. What suggestions could be provided to riders on their ability?</p>
				   <p>Finally, we used affinity diagramming to capture common themes from our generated ideas. The top five concepts were selected, and the nexpanded upon through a conceptual model and critical path.</p>

The second concept dealt with increasing other motorist awareness of the rider's presence.</p>
				   <p>The team conducted additional rounds of ideation and brainstorming around each concept to ensure alignment to the target problem and users, as well as possible lists of features and affordances they could provide.</p>
