                        <p>Few things compare to the experience of riding. From the feel of the bike
						beneath your body, to the way the tires grab the road as you round into a
						curve, nothing compares to the visceral immersion with the environment as
						the wind blows past your body. Yet, any feelings of exuberance and liberation
						aside, motorcyclists find themselves in dangerous and even life-threatening
						situations on a daily basis.</p><br/>
						<p>Skry is the first advanced awareness and hazard reporting system for motorcyclists. This system leverages map, weather, and traffic data, as well as crowdsourced feedback from other riders, to alert a ride of what's up ahead on their route. With the user of voice UI and HUD, the rider is forewarned of impending events, without taking their eyes off the road or their hands off the controls.</p>

                     <p>Although motorcyclists account for just 3% of the vehicles registered, they make up 14% of al traffic fatalities (NTSA, 2015). In fact, if a motorcyclist is in a traffic accident they are 26 times more likely to die than if they were in a car. Given those statistics, motorcycling is one of the most dangerous methods of transportation in the world.</p>
					 <p>To date, no technology exists to specifically support the rider in providing increased situational awareness about what is ahead on their route. As such, the target user for this study were motorcyclists who use navigation while riding.</p>

                   <p>We began our project with a focus on answering the following three research questions in order to gain a deep understanding into our problem space.</p>
				   <p>1. What types of situations or environments would a rider need an increase in situational awareness?</p>
				   <p>2. What situations and environments are perceived as dangerous by the rider?</p>
				   <p>3. When are riders cognitively taxed?</p>
				   <p>We answered these questions using the following methods:</p>

                  <div class="contentH3">Literature Review</div>
                   <p>Through our literature review, we found that motorcycling requires a high level of situational awareness. While on the bike, the rider is constantly perceiving information about their environment, processing that information, and then making a decision on how to react while managing their own mental and physical workload (Bellet & Banet, 2012).</p>
				   <p>The necessity to maintain a high level of situational awareness is further magnified by the lack of protection that a motorcycle provides vs a car due to the lack of a protective barrier beteen the rider and their environment. A list of common hazards for riders was identified based on a report of recent trends in motorcycle crashes published by the NHTSA.</p>

				   <p>We focused on identifying the most dangerous situations riders encountered, as well as what technological solutions they wished for the most. We also asked for basic demographic information such as age, experience level, gear used, willingness to adopt new technology, and riding environment (city vs rural)

				   <div class="contentH3">Expert Interview</div>
                   <p>We interviewed 5 subject matter experts from UW, Harley Davidson, Garmin, and BMW and learned that the design of a system to support the rider should make them smarter on the road. Specificallly it should shorten the time between intent and action, and anticipate the needs of the rider to help them make quick and accurate decisions through meaningful and relevant information. One example demoed to us was the BMW Navigator V used for navigation.</p>
				   <p>We also learned that over reliance on a system could lead to degradation in riding skills. An example was blind spot indicators in cars, which could lead to riders becoming less aware of what's coming up behind them. We observed this in action by shadowing a user study by Dr. Linda Boyle, who is a transportation expert in automotive safety at UW. She runs a car simulator on campus which is used to test for cognitive overload/reaction time for automotive UI design.</p>

                   <p>After that, we conducted interviews with 7 riders from varying levels of riding experience. The interviews were recorded and later transcribed for key quotes which were placed on post it notes. Then we created an affinity diagram using the post it notes to identify common themes from our participants which were:</p>
				   <p>1. Visibility is key to safety</p>
				   <p>2. Drivers are inattentive & unaware of motorcycles</p>
				   <p>3. Riding requires a high level of awareness of self, system, and the environment</p>
				   <p>4. Technology should be adaptive and can't overload the rider</p>
				   <p>5. Riding is a way of life, so technology should not detract from the experience</p>

				   <p>We also conducted a card-sorting task to rank how frequently riders encounter certain hazards and which ones they perceive to be the most dangerous. Situations involving cars were ranked as the most dangerous. However all riders spoke of mitigation strategies to deal with this such as making sure the driver looks them in the eye before turning or revving their engine to make others aware of them.</p>
				   <p>Unexpected hazards like gravel, oil, bad weather, etc were regularly encountered by 6 out of the 7 riders interviewed. Although they weren't ranked as dangerous as other drivers, there were no mitigation strategies available due to the lack of time to respond. Many of them also stated that they had dropped their bike due to these unexpected hazards.</p>

                   <p>Based on our research we came up with 3 key findings:</p>
				   <p>1. The system should avoid cognitive overload while giving the rider time to plan ahead</p>
				   <p>2. Other drivers are the biggest danger to riders, and visibility is key to safety</p>
				   <p>3. A successful system should not interfere with the rider's experience on the road</p>
				   <br>
				   <p>These were then transformed into design prompts for our ideation phase:</p>
				   <p>1. How can we reduce the cognitive load of motorcyclists?</p>
				   <p>2. What information can we provide to others on the road about motorcyclist behavior?</p>
				   <p>3. What suggestions could be provided to riders based on their ability?</p>

                   <p>Before moving onto the ideation phase, we also conducted a competitive analysis to make sure an existing system didn't already exist that could satisfy the needs of the rider. It would have to provide situational awareness of what's up ahead and allow the rider to easily and safely interact with the system while on the road.</p>
				   
				   <p>We identified three current systems available today: Waze, BMW Navigator V, and Skully AR-1. After completing the competitive analysis, we found that although each system had its strengths, there was no one system currently existed to support the rider in all the criteria we had identified from our user research.</p>

				  <div class="contentH3">Ideation Overview</div>
                   <p>We leveraged both unstructured and structured ideation activities to help generate a broad set of concepts for our design problem. To start, we began diverging from our initial research insights, through generative ideation with thumbnail sketches.
				   <p>Then we converged and refined our generated ideas through design exercises such as scenario creation business origami toolkits, and mind mapping. Finally, we iterated, going through another round of divergence/convergence, using affinity diagraming to hone in on our design direction.</p>

                   <p>To finalize the concept, we mapped our 5 concepts and the features they could provide to 2 distinct directions using an affinity diagram. One was to increase other motorists awareness of the rider's presence, while ther other was to provide awareness to the rider that allows them to mitigate risks beforehand.</p>
				   <p>We ultimately decided to go with the second direction, as it's much easier to increase the rider's awareness then it is to increase other drivers, at least until vehicle to vehicle communication is available with 5G and IOT. The concept we ended up picking from this design direction was the hazard alert and reporting system, similar to Waze but catered towards motorcyclists.</p>

                   <p>We created a storyboard of our final concept, where the system alerts the rider of upcoming hazards and events through a mobile app connected to a rider's bluetooth headset. The rider would also be able to alert others through a recorded message. While not shown, the rider could also plan their trip and review their post-ride report through the app as well. We decided to call our concept "Skry" as it provides a look into the future.</p>

                   <p>In order to validate our concept, we conducted 3 evaluations. The first iteration focused on building a paper prototype of the mobile app and evaluating the variables that would be used during testing such as iconography, tones, and possible scenarios. The second and third iteration focused on testing the HUD and Voice UI in varying fidelities using wizard of oz prototyping as well as a higher fidelity version of the mobile app.</p>

                   <p>In the first phase of testing we conducted a small focus group with participatory design to learn about road symbology, hazards, and button placement. When discussing symbology and hazards, we presented images to the group and asked for opinions. For button placement, we asked riders to sit on their motorcycle and imagine what it would be like to geo-tag a hazard on the road. We provided stickers and asked them to place it where they believed the button should be placed.</p>

				  </div>
				   <p>From the focus group, we found that certain standardized icons like fog weren't easily recognizable. Participants also stated  they would like to know about issues that already have signage such as construction zones or deer crossing but would likely not report it to others. For button placement, safety and convenience was key, although some suggested using voice activation for riders with bluetooth headsets as it was safer/easier.</p>

                   <p>The second part of the first phase was testing how users might actually interact with the system while on the road. Participants sat on their motorcycles and the facilitator walked them through a trip between two destinations using the system. Participants were asked to think-aloud during their ride and were told they did not need to report or confirm any event if they did not want to.</p>
				   <p>1. To simulate a hazard alert, users were alerted with an audible "beep" by the facilitator and presented with an image of an icon.</p>
				   <p>2. When a crowdsourced message was relayed, the faciliator recited the message and held up an image of the upcoming event. User's were asked to confirm or deny the existence of the event.</p>
				   <p>3. For a non-reported hazard, an image of the hazard was shown without the auditory alert. If the user wished to report the hazard, they would press a button that was affixed to their motorcycle beforehand.</p>

				  </div>
				  <p>Our participants stated they felt good about reporting serious hazards to other riders because it would help others ride safer. They also liked the personalization aspect of hearing someone's recorded message but expressed concerns about not being able to understand the message due to noise/accent. They also wanted additional info such as the length and severity of the hazard. Before hearing a report, they would like it to be validated in some way (i.e. multiple reports). Both users were fine with viewing and confirming their own reports, but not others.</p>

                   <p>For the second test, we focused on constructing a wizard of oz prototype that would be more interactive, based on feedback from the first user test. Participants would be playing a motorcycle simulation game on an iPad to simulate the cognitive load of riding, and hazards and alert tones would appear in a split-screen view following our test script:</p>
				   <p>1. Users were first given a brief demo of the system to help onboard them as to how it worked.</p>
				   <p>2. They were expected to initiate the system we created (Skry) when reporting a hazard, by saying the clutch "Skry report."</p>
				   <p>3. This was then followed by a confirmation tone, where the user could then record a message of the hazard they encountered.</p>
				   <p>4. Once the message was complete, the user would then say "Skry end", which was followed by an end tone.</p>
				   <p>5. When encountering a reported hazard, the system would provide a hazard alert tone as the user entered the hazard zone, coupled with a HUD icon of the hazard with text.</p>
				   <p>6. After the user has exited the hazard zone, they would hear an end tone, and then be prompted after 5 seconds to confirm/deny the hazard with a confirmation tone.</p>
				   <p>7. Once the ride was complete, the user was asked to confirm/deny hazards through an updated paper prototype.</p>
