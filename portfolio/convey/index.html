						<p>Convey is a phone dock that helps patients
						communicate with their loved ones by providing them

                     <p>Pandemics are a growing concern in an increasingly connected world. One of the largest pandemics, was Ebola in 2014, which affected several countries in Africa. Unfortunately at the time, many organizations and countries like the World Health Organization(WHO) and the United States did not take the issue seriously, leading to a very slow response. </p>
					 <p>For this project, my team consisting of 4 designers focused on exploring solutions for a hypothetical Ebola Pandemic in Walla Walla, WA, which is located in a rural area and may not have the same level of resources as a hospital in a major city.</p>

                  <div class="contentH3">Design Process</div>
                     <p>The design process for this project began with user research to understand the key problems, followed by ideation to generate concepts, and then concluding with prototyping and testing to evaluate the final concept. I was responsible for leading the prototyping/testing phase, building the prototypes and interactions in both 2D and 3D space, along with conducting the user testing. For the user research and ideation phases, I worked collaboratively with the other designers to investigate the problem space and come up with potential concepts.</p>

                     <p>In order to better understand the problem space, we interviewed a subject matter expert, Dr. Phil Green, who specializes in Emergency Medicine and works in Walla Walla, Washington. In addition, he is also the pandemic response coordinator for parts of Oregon and Washington and has written a book called "Trauma Room Two". He identified several key problems that needed to be solved.</p>
					 <p>1.	People diagnosed with Ebola may not be able to see or move due to blood in their eyes, vomiting, diarrhea, etc. Designs should be multimodal to account for loss of certain senses. </p>
                     <p>2.	Anything an Ebola patient touches must be incinerated, so any design that comes into contact with a patient must be low-cost, disposable, or contamination proof.</p>
					 <p>3.	Patients sent to quarantine need a meaningful way to keep in contact with family or loved ones, as they will be extremely stressed, and need someone who can reassure them.</p>

For the Home Blood Test Kit, the branching path occurs during the first stage, while the user is still at home.</p>

					 <p>The Concept Evaluation Plot was generated based on the Matrix, to help divide the concepts based on whether they were strong for boht users and providers, which is ideal. The triangle was created by drawing a line from the highest Provider and user scores.</p>

                     <p>We chose to change our original idea of a Communication Flower to a Snowglobe Phone Dock, based on peer feedback we received. By replacing it with a phone dock, two-way communication was now possible, which was a major drawback for the flower idea, as it only allowed one-way radio communction. It was also much more affordable, which helped improve the concept's value for providers.</p>

We also felt it served patient's needs best, when they have been separated from their family for an extended period of time. We created a storyboard of the final concept illustrating the importance that patients have something in their room, that lets the family communicate with them from afar.</p>

                     <p>When we decided on building a prototype of our pandemic proposed smartphone dock, we chose to focus on the look and feel of the prototoype. As a result, we chose to model our prototype in the 3D space, using 3D printing as a means to allow the user to touch our design. It also allowed for  ambient visual feedback, through the glow of LEDs in the translucent plastic.</p>
					 <p>The concept was first modeled using SolidWorks, and then transferred to Makerbot Desktop as an STL file in order to print with a Flashforge Pro 3D printer. We chose to split the model into multiple slices so it would be easier to print. An acrylic screen was also added, serving as the visible barrier between the user and their phone.</p>

                     <p>We wanted to create a UI that was easily visible and simple enough to use for someone in bed at a hospital. We decided to call our app Convey, as it served to convey a loved one's message from afar. A logo was designed to embody this through a hand reaching out and was colored blue, which is both soothing and reflects the hygienic nature of the medical field.</p>
					 <p>After exploring our options and constraints, we decided to create a user interface simulating an outgoing and incoming call. Simple diagrams aid the user in understanding how the touch interactions work, and are large enough for them view through the acrylic screen. During calls, a comforting image of their loved one is displayed. </p>

                     <p>Since we were targeting patients in a pandemic situation, we wanted our prototype to provide clearly distinguishable states through audio and visual feedback. However, the feedback couldn't be too strong, or it would be distracting to the user. We decided to go with LEDs for visual feedback, while using a buzzer to provide audio feedback. It would be triggered by a light sensor, which was found to be the least obstrusive.</p>
					<p>We decided to implement this using Arduino, due to the ease of use and cost of materials. We were able to buy all the required parts for less than $100, and were able to quickly rapid prototype using fritzing for the wiring diagram and arduino scripts such as pitches.sh. Several lighting schemes and patterns were tested to determine which sequence would work best with our UI.</p>

                  <div class="contentH3">Testing</div>
                     <p>Throughout our protoyping process, we conducted informal tests with others to gauge the effectiveness of our prototype. The insights we gained from observing people interact with our prototype as well as the feedback they provided helped guide us on improvements for the next iteration, such as the led strip to provide a stronger visual cue, or playing a ringtone during an incoming call.</p>
				     <p>We evaluated our final prototype through Wizard of Oz testing. After giving users a brief overview of how Convey works, we gave them instructions for making a call. As the user interacted with the phone dock, we had someone sitting behind a laptop changing the screens accordingly. We then asked each person a short series of questions to learn what they liked and didn't liked about the experience.</p>

                  <div class="contentH3">Conclusion</div>
                     <p>Our prototype was an effective test in demonstrating that a phone dock could be used to easily make and receive calls through voice and touch input. Through our user testing, we found that the form was ergonomic for people to touch as well as easy to use based on the simplicity of our UI. It took some users awhile to discover the touch input, but this could easily be remedied through extra visual cues at the top of the dock.</p>
                     <p>While our prototype was effective in demonstrating the basic interactions of the phone dock, we would probably need an addiitonal iteration integrating real-time voice interactions for a more complete behavorial prototype instead of using Wizard of Oz concepts before moving forward. After making these changes, we could move on to testing our prototype with patients in a real-life hospital setting. </p>
